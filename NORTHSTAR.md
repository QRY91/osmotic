# Osmotic News North Star 🧠

**Last updated**: June 2025

## 🎯 The One Problem We Solve

**Provide world awareness without engagement addiction.**

Transform information overload into osmotic patterns that inform without distracting. Know what people are going through to build meaningful solutions.

## 🚨 Focus Guardrails (Anti-Scope-Creep)

### ✅ Core Mission (Always Yes)
- Daily RSS processing → pattern extraction → accumulated intelligence
- Local LLM analysis for persistent themes and confidence scoring
- Pull-based awareness checks (no feeds, no notifications)
- Privacy-first, zero telemetry architecture

### 🚫 Tempting Distractions (Always No Until Core Is Perfect)
- ❌ Personalized recommendations or feeds
- ❌ Social features or sharing capabilities
- ❌ Real-time streaming or push notifications
- ❌ Cloud services or external APIs
- ❌ Complex analytics dashboards
- ❌ Integration with social media platforms

## 🌊 The Osmosis Standard (Simple Truth)

**"Absorb patterns, not noise. Know the world state, stay focused on building."**

- **Local-first over cloud-dependent** - your awareness patterns stay private
- **Patterns over events** - persistent themes, not daily chaos
- **Pull over push** - check when YOU want to know
- **Intelligence over engagement** - no dopamine hooks, pure information

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage (Anti-Engagement)

**We're the only news tool that actively fights engagement addiction.**

Most news platforms: *Optimize for clicks, scrolling, and time-on-site*  
Osmotic News: *Optimize for rapid awareness and return to focused work*

**Positioning**: "World awareness without the engagement trap"

## 🎯 Success Metric (Single Source of Truth)

**The 30-Second Test**: "Can I get world awareness in 30 seconds and return to focused work?"

**If I'm spending time in the tool, I've built an engagement hook. If I'm informed, I've won.**

**Weekly question**: "Did Osmotic help me stay world-aware without getting distracted from my work?"

**Secondary metrics**:
- Time spent in tool (should be under 2 minutes daily)
- Pattern confidence accuracy over time
- User reports of maintained focus on primary work

## ⚡ Core Workflow (Sacred & Simple)

```bash
# 1. Initialize (daily background process)
osmotic daemon start

# 2. Quick awareness check (30 seconds)
osmotic status

# 3. Focused deep dive (2 minutes when needed)
osmotic deep --region=europe --topic=economy

# 4. Context for work (when relevant)
osmotic relevance --project=your-work

# → Return to focused building
# → No feeds, no scrolling, no engagement trap
```

## 🚫 Anti-Feature-Creep Rules

### Before Adding ANYTHING:
1. **Does this make pattern recognition more accurate?**
2. **Can we improve the core osmotic absorption instead?**
3. **Does this keep data local and private?**
4. **Would a focused builder want this interruption?**

### The Focus Test
*If someone deep in flow state can't get world awareness in under 2 minutes and return to work, it's too engaging.*

## 🔥 Intelligence Quality Imperative

**The Real Differentiator**: Must provide genuine insight without creating distraction.

**Quality Standards**:
- Patterns must be validated across diverse sources
- Confidence scoring improves with accumulation
- Geographic and temporal context always preserved
- Zero engagement optimization or addiction mechanics

## 🎪 Current State vs. North Star

### ✅ Current Foundation (Conceptual)
- Architecture defined: RSS → LLM → SQLite → CLI
- Integration patterns with existing microstudio tools
- Anti-engagement principles established
- Local-first privacy requirements documented

### 🎯 North Star Simplicity
- **Pure CLI with rich TUI** (bubbletea/lipgloss) - no web interface needed
- **AI-compatible by design** - CLI-first means AI agents can use it natively
- **Self-destruct mode** - `--secret-agent` briefings auto-close after 30s
- **Optional lockout** - Prevent re-access for specified duration (addiction management)
- Core commands: `status`, `deep`, `health`, `relevance`
- Background daemon for daily processing
- Pattern confidence scoring and source diversity
- Complete privacy and offline capability

## 🎨 Marketing Honesty Principle

**Underpromise, overdeliver.** Show the working osmotic absorption, not AI buzzwords.

**Tone Standards**:
- Calm but honest about being early-stage development
- "Pattern recognition" not "Revolutionary AI intelligence"
- "World awareness" not "Comprehensive global monitoring"
- "Local processing" not "Military-grade privacy"
- "Osmotic absorption" metaphor is our brand (it's perfect)

**Core Honesty Rules**:
- ✅ Show what's actually processing patterns today
- ✅ Be clear about what's planned vs delivered
- ✅ Confidence in the vision, honesty about the state
- ❌ No engagement optimization or addiction mechanics
- ❌ No AI buzzwords for basic RSS processing

**Philosophy**: Build a tool that respects human attention. Let people know what's happening in the world so they can build solutions that matter. Good awareness tools don't steal focus.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Osmosis (Next 3 months)
1. **RSS aggregation system** - diverse global sources
2. **Local LLM pattern extraction** - reliable theme recognition
3. **SQLite accumulation** - multi-day intelligence building

### Phase 2: Intelligence Refinement (Months 4-6)
1. **Source diversity scoring** - bias detection and balancing
2. **Geographic clustering** - regional pattern understanding
3. **Confidence algorithms** - validated pattern reliability

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration (If Phase 2 Succeeds)
1. **WhereWasI context sharing** - world state for AI handoffs
2. **DoggoWoof source monitoring** - RSS infrastructure reuse
3. **Uroboro decision documentation** - how world events influence work

## 🧭 When You're Lost or Distracted

**Read this section.**

1. **Does this help osmotic absorption or create engagement?**
2. **Would you trust this to respect your focused work time?**
3. **Is this solving awareness needs or adding to distraction?**
4. **Does this preserve privacy and local-first principles?**

**Remember**: Builders need world awareness to create meaningful solutions. Be the tool that provides that awareness without stealing focus.

## 🔗 Relationship to Your Microstudio

**Complementary awareness layer:**
- **Uroboro**: Documents your work insights and progress
- **DoggoWoof**: Monitors your systems and alerts on problems
- **WhereWasI**: Manages context switching between projects
- **Osmotic**: Maintains world awareness for meaningful building

**Unified philosophy**: Tools that work quietly in the background, respect your attention, help you focus on what matters, and stay completely private.
